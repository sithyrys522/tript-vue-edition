## About the project
I built a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using vanilla JS, and now I want to reimplement
the same game using Vue. Eventually I'd like to add testing and switch over to 
Typescript, but for now getting the game working in Vue will be a fun small goal.

### TODO
- Finish core game
- Add testing
- OPTIONAL: Convert to typescript
